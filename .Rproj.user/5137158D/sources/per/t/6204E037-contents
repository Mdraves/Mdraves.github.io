# Dissertation Project:

My dissertation project is focused on characterizing maize heirlooms from the United States. Over the next three years, I will be working to create comprehensive data sets of almost 1000 maize heirlooms held in the USDA germplasm data base and various seed saver organizations.

### What are maize heirlooms? 

Heirlooms are better known scientifically under the term landrace. Heirlooms are diverse populations that have traditionally been maintained through open pollination. From a historical perspective, heirlooms have been primarily used for food and feeding livestock. Following the Green Revolution, heirlooms were rapidly replaced by hybrids which were a higher yielding alternative.

### Why study maize heirlooms?

Due to the lack of directional selection on maize heirlooms, these populations retain a large amount of genetic diversity. This diversity can be an interesting opportunity for various germplasm resources. In addition, creating a systematic, comprehensive characterization of these heirlooms is a foundational public resource for the maize community.
