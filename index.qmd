Hi! 

My name is Melissa Draves and I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the Flint-Garcia lab at the University of Missouri. My graduate work is focused on maize heirlooms (check out the projects tab to learn more). 

I am originally from Michigan, and moved to Ames, Iowa in 2018 to start my Bachelors of Science in Genetics. While at Iowa State University, I worked in the Kelley lab, mainly focused on auxin response in maize seedlings.
