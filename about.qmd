I was born and raised in Midland, Michigan and was heavily involved in 4-H from a young age. As a 4-H participant I raised and showed lambs for over a decade. When transitioning to college, I decided to explore plant genetics as a way to stay involved in agriculture and work in a fast paced, outdoor environment.

I have had a wide variety of experiences that have contributed to my interest in plant breeding:
